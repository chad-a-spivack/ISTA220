### 1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?

Allows you to evaulate an expression on a variable without redeclaring the variable. Instead of saying answer = answer + 2, you say answer+=2;

### 2. List all the compound assignment operators.

*=, /=, %=, +=, -=

###3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.

variable+= 5; variable-= -5; variable = variable + 5;
variable-= 50; variable += -50; variable = variable - 50;

### 4. How long does a while loop run?

As long as the condition is true.


### 5. What is an iteratiion variable? (Not in book)

A variable that changes every iteration of the loop.


### 6. What happens if you don’t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?

It will iterate forever.

### 7. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of them? What happens if you omit all of them?

3.  If you omit the boolean, it will iterate forever.  If you omit the initialization, it just a while loop.  If you omit the condition variable, it will iterate forever.


### 8. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?

Run a do while statement.

### 9. What does the break statement do?

Breaks out of an iteration.

### 10. What does the continue statement do?

Performs the iteration immediately after evaluating the boolean.

### 11. (Thought question) Can you think of any reason why you would want to have an infinite loop? An 
“infinite loop” is a loop without an update variable that in effect runs forever. As you will see, these
kinds of loops are written intentionally to perform various kinds of tasks.
