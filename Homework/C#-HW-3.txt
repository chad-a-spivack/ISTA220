### 1. What is a method?

A named sequence of statements.  Named block of code that optionally accepts input and returns output.

### 2. What is the difference between a function and a procedure/subprocedure/subroutine?

A function is used to calculate a result whereas a procedure is used to perform certain tasks in order.

### 3. What does a return statement do?

Returns information that is the same as the return type as long as the type is not *void*.

### 4. What is an expression bodied statement do?

Uses the "=>" operator to reference the body of a method and does not require a return statement.  It simplifies the expression.

### 5. What is the scope of a variable?

It defines where the variable can be accessed.  If the variable is within a method, it is considered to be in scope.

### 6. What is a field?

A variable defined by a class.

### 7. What is an overloaded method?

Two identifiers declared within the same scope that have the same name.  More than 1 methods with the same name.  You tell them apart from the parameter list.

### 8. How do you call a method that requires arguments?

Using comma separated list of arguments inside the parantheses of the method, and the number and type of the arguments are used to determine which overloaded method to use.

### 9. How do you write a method, that is, specify the method definition, that requires a parameter list?

 You specify the type of the method. Name the method. Parameter list. Body of the method.

### 10. How do you specify a parameter as optional when defining a method?

Declare a default value for the variable at the end of the parameter list.

### 11. How do you pass an argument to a method as a named parameter?

Call the method, and then input the the values for each parameter.

### 12.  How do you return values from a method?  Can you return multiple values from a method, and if so, how?

Have a return statement in your method body.  Yes, just add additional return values.

### 13. What is a tuple? How do you define a method that returns multiple values? Give an example of a method that returns multiple values other the example in the book.

A tuple is a small collection of values.  Specify a list of types as part of the definition; one type for each value returned.

```
	myMethod()
	{
		int int1;
		int int2;
		return (int1, int2);
	}
```

### 14.  Examine the method definition on page 83.  Desk check the execution.  What do you discover?  This is called recursion.

dataValue changes as the method runs because of the IF ElSE statement until dataValue = 1. 

### 15.  How does the compiler resolve an ambiguity between named arguments and optional parameters?

If a named argument deosn't match the parameter type, the compiler will default to the default value.

### 16.  The book states " A key feature of C# abd ither languages designed for the .NET Framewrok is the ability to interoperate with application and ompenents wrriten
with other technologies." What is the COM and how is the CLR dependent on the COM?

COM is the component object model. The CLR is dependent on the COM because it allows for optional arguments.
