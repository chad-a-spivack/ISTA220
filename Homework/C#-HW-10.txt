### 1. What does an array look like in memory?

A contiguous block all of the same type and are accessed by using an index

### 2. Where is memory allocated to hold an array, on the stack or on the heap?

On the heap. They are reference types.

### 3. Where is memory allocated to hold an array reference, on the stack or on the heap?

on the stack

### 4. Can an array hold values of different types? This is a trick question, the answer is, “It depends.” What
determines the types that an array can hold?

no, they have to be the same value. You can create an array that holds reference types to other arrays.

### 5. Describe the syntax of the condition for a foreach loop.

declares an iteration variable for the the referenced array.

### 6. How do you make a deep copy of a array?

Create a new array instance and then copy each element into the new array.

### 7. What is the difference in the syntax between a multi-dimensional array and an array of arrays?

multi = [,].  array of arrays = [][]

### 8. What is the difference in the uses for a multi-dimensional array and an array of arrays? In other words,
what determines whether you would use one as opposed to the other?

if you need to use a lot of data constantly than use a multi.  If you do not to allocate the amount of memory used for a multi, than a jagged is your answer.

### 9. How do you flatten a multidimensional array?

Create a jagged array for the multidimensional array.

### 10. (Thought question) When we use a for loop, we can change the values of the array elements inside
the loop. When we use a foreach loop, we cannot change the values of the arry elements inside the
loop. Why not? How is for different from foreach?

In foreach, you are dereferencing the elements so there is no way to change the index number.
