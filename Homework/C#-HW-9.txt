### 1. What is an enum?

Lives on the stack. Values are limited to a set of symbolic names.

### 2. Declare an enum for military ranks, either officer or enlisted. Name it Ranks. What are the symbols,
like Private, Corporal, Sergeant or Lieutenant, Captain, Major?

enum Ranks {private, private first class, specialist, sergeant, etc..}

### 3. Using the Ranks enum, assign a rank to yourself and a friend.

Ranks Chad = Ranks.SSG;
Ranks Will = Ranks.CPT;

### 4. Determine the numeric index of particular ranks, using the Ranks enum.


0 = private, 1 = PFC, 2 = specialist, 3 = sergeant etc.


### 5. How do you select the type of an enum?

enum ranks : short {private, pFC, etc.}

### 6. What is a struct?

value type that can have its own methods and fields.

### 7. List some differences between classes and structs.

You can't declare a default constructor of a struct. You cannot initialize instance fields at their point of declartion.

### 8. Are structs stored on the stack or on the heap? What about enums?

stack.  enums are on the stack as well.

### 9. Review the documentation for the C# System.Int32 struct. List the fields. List the methods.

MaxValue and MinValue are the fields. CompareTO, Equals, GetHashCode,GetTypeCode, Parse, ToString, TryFormat, TryParse are the methods.

### 10. Declare a struct named DOD with four branches.

Struct DOD
{
	private string Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force;
	
	public DOD(string army, string navy, string, marines, string Air_force)
	{
		Army = army;
		Navy = navy;
		Marines = marines;
		Air_Force = Air_force;
	}
}

### 11. Why canâ€™t you create a default constructor for a struct?

The compiler always generates one for structs.


### 12. What is CIL? What does the CLR do to the CIL?

Common Intermediate Language. Turns souce code into machine code.
