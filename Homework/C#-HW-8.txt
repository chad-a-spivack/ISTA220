### 1. What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?

Deep copy copies reference to fields, or you follow the pointer to the heap.  Shallow just copies what is on the stack.

### 2. What is the value of a reference after you declare and initialize it?

whatever the value you initialized it to.

### 3. How do you declare a value type?

int a = 0 for example.

### 4. How do you declare a reference type?

circle c = new circle();

### 5. Does C# allow you to assign NULL to a value type?

No, but with a ? next to data type you can.

### 6. Can you assign a nullable value type to a non-nullable variable of the same type? Why or why not?

no.  one value might contain null whereas the other may not.

### 7. What is the difference between the stack and the heap?

Stack memory is organized.  Heap is disorganized. Stack stores values directly.  Heap stores references.

### 8. What does it mean when we say that all classes are specialized types?

Every class is a type.  Rthe integer type is a class, the double type is a class.  It is a way of organizing the program.

### 9. What does ref do?

Passes a reference to the actual argument rather than the copy. The memory address, not the value.

### 10. What does out do?

It allows a method itself to initialize a parameter.

### 11. Describe boxing and unboxing in your own words.

Boxing creates an instance of memory on the heap that assigns it a reference value.  Unboxing is casting the boxed variable to the other reference variable.

### 12. What does cast do?

Obtains a value of the boxed copy.
